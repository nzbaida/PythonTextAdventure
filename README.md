# PythonTextAdventure
Text-based adventure game focused on turn-based combat. 

Allows 2 players to customize their character name, description, race, and gender (race and gender affect in game stats).

After character creation, players take turns purchasing weapons, armor, and restorative items from a trader.

Once combat begins, players take turns using items to restore their own health and armor or attacking the enemy.

Can be run like all other Python console applications.
